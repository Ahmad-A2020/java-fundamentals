This is 401 level:
- in lab 01, I created a Main.java file in basics directory.
- whithin the main class three methods were added which are:
  - pluralize:   that accepts a word and a number and returns a string with the word pluralized with an “s” if the number is zero, or greater than one.
  - flipNHeads: that accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row.
  - clock: that uses Java’s built-in LocalDateTime object to constantly print out the current time to the console, second by second.
